# Abdiaziz Aden's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website showcases my work, provides information about me, and allows you to get in touch with me. It serves as a platform to highlight my skills, projects, and experiences as a software developer.

# USER STORY

As a user, I want to view a potential employee's previous work and learn more about their skills and experience. I expect a user-friendly interface that allows me to easily navigate through different sections of the portfolio. Additionally, I want the portfolio to be responsive, providing an optimal browsing experience on various devices and screen sizes.
